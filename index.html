        <p>The Directorate General of Training (DGT) in Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship
         is the apex organisation for development and coordination at National level for the programmes
          relating to vocational training including Women's Vocational Training. Industrial Training Institutes
           are under the administrative and financial control of State Governments or Union Territory
           Administrations. DGT also operates Vocational Training Schemes in some of the specialized areas 
           through field institutes under its direct control. Development of these programmes at national level, 
           particularly in the area concerning common policies, common standards and procedures, training of
           instructors and trade testing are the responsibility of the DGT. But, day-to-day administration of 
           Industrial Training Institutes rests with the State Governments/ Union Territories Administrations.
